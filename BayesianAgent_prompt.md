I want to create an agent for creating/reviewing Bayesian model specification files. For this, the user can select/use WinBUG, JAGS, or newer Stan. All the refs are available in refs folder. Read every single one of them and then create a Claude agent so that the user can tell the agent to provide them with a specific model or review their model.

For Claude agent, you can see a good example in /Users/choxos/Documents/GitHub/ITC-agents/example. Make sure you consider every single detail. Write tests to see if your agent passes or not.

Let's GO!
